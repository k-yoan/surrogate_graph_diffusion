# Surrogate Models for Diffusion on Graphs: A High-Dimensional Polynomial Approach

This repository contains the code and data for the numerical experiments conducted as part of the paper "Surrogate Models for Diffusion on Graphs via Sparse Polynomial Approximation", which is based on Kylian Ajavon's Master's thesis research at Concordia University. The paper is co-authored byKylian Ajavon and Dr. Simone Brugiapaglia, with Dr. Giuseppe Alessio Dâ€™Inverno as the lead author.

## Overview

This repository includes the implementation of the numerical experiments described in Section 4 of the paper. The experiments involve ...
